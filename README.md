## About Torben Haack

Hi, I'm Torben; a software engineer passionate about building, learning, and sharing knowledge.

- **Background:** Grew up in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Started with Minecraft servers and plugins, which sparked a lifelong curiosity for how things work.
- **Current:** Working as a professional Software Engineer.
- **Philosophy:** Software is about creating order from chaos, expressing ideas through structure, and building things that last. I believe in minimalism, iteration, and sharing what I learn.
- **Teaching:** Led workshops on Git and best practices, mentored apprentices, and advocate for open, accessible knowledge.
- **Projects:**
  - MYP (Manage Your Printer): Enterprise printer management (Next.js, TypeScript)
  - PromptLab: Modular prompt engineering tool (React, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS)
  - Warp-Themes: Theme builder for Warp Terminal & VS Code
  - HAFAS Station Monitor: Public transit dashboard
  - Countless experiments, plugins, and web tools

When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading, writing, working out, or exploring new ideas. If you find inspiration or guidance here, that's all I could hope for.
