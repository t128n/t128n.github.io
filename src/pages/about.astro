      <h2>from small town to software</h2>
      <p>
        i grew up in a small town in schleswig-holstein, germany - one of
        those places where the world feels both wide open and a little out of
        reach. my journey into tech began with minecraft. what started as a
        game quickly became a gateway: i wanted to know how things worked
        behind the scenes. i started hosting servers, writing plugins and soon
        found myself building web tools to make minecraft more accessible.
        that curiosity - how things work, how to shape your own little world -
        never left me.
      </p>
      <p>
        after finishing my a-levels in social studies (2.8), i moved to
        berlin, eager for new challenges. i spent time building independent
        projects-like a hafas station monitor to keep up with public transit
        departures - while deepening my skills and preparing for the next
        step.

      <h2>why i build</h2>
      <p>
        for me, software is about more than code. it's about creating order
        from chaos, expressing ideas through structure and shaping digital
        spaces with their own rules and logic. i love the feeling of building
        something from scratch - of seeing a project evolve from a rough
        prototype to something elegant and minimal. my approach is simple:
        dive in, get your hands dirty and iterate until it feels right. done
        is better than perfect, but minimalism and structure keep us grounded.

      <h2>learning, teaching, sharing</h2>
      <p>
        i'm a self-taught learner at heart. i love reading, writing and
        exploring new ideas - whether it's philosophy, software, or just how
        we do things. early in my career, i discovered that teaching is the
        best way to learn. during my apprenticeship at a german automotive
        company, i led workshops on git and software best practices and later
        mentored new apprentices. i believe knowledge should be free and
        accessible and that everyone does their best when given the chance to
        grow.

      <h2>what matters most</h2>
      <p>
        i care about sharing knowledge, building things that last and helping
        others feel a little less lost on their own journey. i'm just someone
        who loves to learn, build and teach. if you find inspiration or
        guidance here, that's all i could hope for.

      <h2>beyond the code</h2>
      <p>
        when i'm not building software, you'll find me working out, reading,
        writing, or thinking about life's big (and small) questions. i believe
        in minimalism, curiosity and the power of a well-placed idea.
