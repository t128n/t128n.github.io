        <h2>From Small Town to Software</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in a small town in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany - one of
          those places where the world feels both wide open and a little out of
          reach. My journey into tech began with Minecraft. What started as a
          game quickly became a gateway: I wanted to know how things worked
          behind the scenes. I started hosting servers, writing plugins, and
          soon found myself building web tools to make Minecraft more
          accessible. That curiosity - how things work, how to shape your own
          little world - never left me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing my A-levels in Social Studies (2.8), I moved to
          Berlin, eager for new challenges. I spent time building independent
          projects-like a HAFAS station monitor to keep up with public transit
          departures - while deepening my skills and preparing for the next
          step.

        <h2>Why I Build</h2>
        <p>
          For me, software is about more than code. It's about creating order
          from chaos, expressing ideas through structure, and shaping digital
          spaces with their own rules and logic. I love the feeling of building
          something from scratch - of seeing a project evolve from a rough
          prototype to something elegant and minimal. My approach is simple:
          dive in, get your hands dirty, and iterate until it feels right. Done
          is better than perfect, but minimalism and structure keep us grounded.

        <h2>Learning, Teaching, Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught learner at heart. I love reading, writing, and
          exploring new ideas - whether it's philosophy, software, or just how
          we do things. Early in my career, I discovered that teaching is the
          best way to learn. During my apprenticeship at Mercedes-Benz, I led
          workshops on Git and software best practices, and later mentored new
          apprentices. I believe knowledge should be free and accessible, and
          that everyone does their best when given the chance to grow.

        <h2>What Matters Most</h2>
        <p>
          I care about sharing knowledge, building things that last, and helping
          others feel a little less lost on their own journey. I'm just someone
          who loves to learn, build, and teach. If you find inspiration or
          guidance here, that's all I could hope for.

        <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not building software, you'll find me working out, reading,
          writing, or thinking about life's big (and small) questions. I believe
          in minimalism, curiosity, and the power of a well-placed idea.
