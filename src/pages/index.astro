	<p>
		I build internal platforms that remove friction from software development—CI/CD 
        pipelines, test frameworks, deployment tooling, and reproducible docs. At Mercedes-Benz’s 
        Digital Factory Campus in Berlin, I design developer infrastructure that scales: automating workflows, 
        enforcing consistency, and supporting industrial systems through pragmatic architecture.
