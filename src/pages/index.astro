	<p>
		I engineer robust, minimalist software solutions grounded in proven
		methodologies, emphasizing clarity, reliability, and maintainability. At
		Mercedes-Benz's Digital Factory Campus in Berlin, I architect and
		develop internal data platforms, developer tooling, and automation
		systems that streamline engineering workflows and support industrial
		operations. My work spans CI/CD automation, data pipeline integration,
		test frameworks, and reproducible documentation systems. My approach
		ensures practical, efficient, and scalable software that consistently
		delivers long-term value.
