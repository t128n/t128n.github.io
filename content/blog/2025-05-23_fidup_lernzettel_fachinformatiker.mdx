At the end of 2024, I successfully completed Part 2 (AP2) of my final exam as an IT Specialist in Data and Process Analysis (FiDuP) with a final grade of 1.4. The preparation was intense but structured. Today, I’m sharing my complete study notes as an open-source project.

## Why I’m publishing my study notes

Education should be accessible. During my preparation, I noticed how fragmented the available materials for FiDuP are. Many resources are either non-existent, costly, or incomplete.

My study notes not only helped me pass but also earned me an excellent grade. Making these materials freely available is my contribution to a better IT training landscape.

## What the repository contains

The [fidup repository](https://github.com/t128n/fidup) is modular and covers all exam-relevant topics:

- **Data Modeling and Database Design**: From ERD to normalization  
- **Programming and Scripting Languages**: Python, SQL, and more  
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Statistical methods and tools  
- **Process Analysis and Optimization**: BPMN, workflow design  
- **Project Management**: Agile methods, traditional PM  
- **IT Security and Data Protection**: GDPR, compliance, backup strategies  
- …and many more topics  

Each section is concise and easy to understand. The notes are based on the Winter 2024/25 exam scope but remain largely relevant for future exams.

## Who these materials are for

Primary audience: Apprentices in the FiDuP field preparing for AP2.  
Secondary audience: Career changers, retrained professionals, or experienced developers seeking formal certification.

The materials assume basic IT knowledge but explain complex concepts from the ground up.

## A note on responsibility

These study notes worked for me, but they’re not error-free. The exam scope can change, and individual learning styles vary. Use them as a supplement to official materials, not as a replacement.

I disclaim any liability for inaccuracies or outdated content. Your exam preparation is your own responsibility.

## How you can contribute

The repository thrives on community input. You can help by:

- Opening **issues** for errors or missing content  
- Submitting **pull requests** for improvements or additions  
- Sharing **feedback** from your own experience  

Contributions from those who have taken the exam or know current changes in the exam scope are especially valuable.

## Why Open Source?

Education thrives through collaboration, not competition. By making my study notes public, I enable:

- **Transparency**: Everyone can see how the materials were developed  
- **Improvement**: The community can fix errors and add content  
- **Accessibility**: No cost, no signup, no paywalls  

Open source also ensures sustainability. Even if I stop actively maintaining the project, the community can carry it forward.

## Next steps

If you’re preparing for FiDuP AP2: Check out the [repository](https://github.com/t128n/fidup) and use it as a starting point for your own preparation.  
If you’ve already taken the exam: Share your experience, correct errors, and add missing content.  
If you’re an instructor: Use the materials in your courses. Professional feedback is especially welcome.

Education works best when knowledge is shared. These study notes are my contribution to that goal.
