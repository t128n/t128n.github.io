For years, I wrestled with the direction of my personal website. I wanted a space to share ideas, projects, and insights—without losing sight of simplicity. Early on, I built micro-apps and experimented with different architectures. But over time, the site drifted from its original intent: a focused, minimal platform for my work and writing.

This reboot is a return to clarity. I'm doubling down on what matters: content, authenticity, and a site that reflects how I work best. The tools I use should empower, not distract.

## What Changed?

**Astro stays.** [Astro](https://astro.build/) remains my static site generator of choice. It matches my workflow and lets me focus on what matters—content and performance—without unnecessary JavaScript bloat.

**TailwindCSS is out.** I'm a fan of TailwindCSS and use it for most projects, but here it's overkill. For a minimal, content-driven blog, semantic HTML wins. No utility classes, just clean markup.

**Micro-apps are gone.** Building them was fun, but they no longer fit the vision. As part of this reboot, I've removed the micro-apps and trimmed away legacy features to keep the site focused and fast. If you landed here from an old /apps link, those tools are no longer hosted, but you can self-host them using the [archived source code on GitHub](https://github.com/t128n/t128n.github.io.archive). This site is now about writing, sharing ideas, and highlighting projects—without the overhead of embedded applications. Simplicity and focus come first.

**CV? Not really.** If you're an employer curious enough to visit my site, you'll find more value in the personal, story-driven [/about](https://t128n.github.io/about) page than a formal CV.


Letting go is tough—but essential. The result? A faster, leaner, and more purposeful site. Content comes first. That's the new standard.
